Go is a trending new programming language to build simple, efficient and reliable software solutions. Like the most modern programming languages it comes with a build in standard library to offer a lot of tools for the Go developers â€“ e.g. io, net/http, os, encoding, strings and many more.

## The goal of this series

This blog article series with the title "Pearls of the Go standard library" pursues the goal to provide a platform where I can write about useful tools, interesting code solutions and "lessons learned" of the Go standard library.

For me a PHP, Java and C# developer, this series is a way to learn more about Go and the mindset of the Go team and contributors. By being an open source project, Go provides a wonderful opportunity to dive into the code of the developers behind this great project.

## What will I write about?

At fino we write all of our new microservices in Go and due to the fact that Go is new to me I haven't worked with all parts of the standard library. Should I come across new tools while working on my projects, I will use this as an opportunity to write an article. The articles have on the one hand the goal that I understand how the tools work and on the other hand to share my knowledge about how they work, or interesting code solutions.

Especially important to me are the "Pearls of the Go standard library", i.e. tools that impress with their design, functionality and possibly with a unique implementation. I will pay special attention to these tools. Using practical code examples, I will show you what the special features are and how you can use them to generate benefits for your own code.

## How often are the articles published?

I plan to publish an article on this topic almost every six weeks. But it can also happen that I write one or two more articles, because my motivation for further education leads me to work on these.
