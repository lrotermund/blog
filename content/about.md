My name is Lukas Rotermund and I am a passionate backend software developer working on APIs and 
e-commerce services for the [tasko Products GmbHs](https://www.tasko.de/), the leading, 
international brand of leather goods and luggage. 

As far as I can remember, Iâ€™ve been developing software. After graduating from technical secondary 
school with a focus on informatics, I went straight into an 
[apprenticeship, a german vocational training system](https://www.bmbf.de/bmbf/en/education/the-german-vocational-training-system/the-german-vocational-training-system_node.html), 
as an IT specialist for application development at 
[Management Services Helwig Schmitt GmbH](https://manserv.de/en/), a global service provider in
the area of market analysis for the automotive industry.

I worked as a web developer at [pixelwerker GmbH](https://pixelwerker.de/) after i graduated and 
was responsible for the development of big web platforms based on Laravel, complex and customized
Wordpress applications, own Wordpress themes and plugins, as well as the rollout and support of
a CI/CD process and a Docker based software development.

Furthermore, I also am a certified trainer for the german vocational training system, which entitles 
me to train an apprentice.

I found a new challenge in developing golang and Java APIs at [fino](https://fino.group/), 
a market-leading innovation driver in account and data analytics, regulatory, tax and document
management technologies. I was responsible for the maintenance and development of the account 
switching service, the {{< abbr "ZKG" "Zahlungskontengesetz/ Payment Accounts Act" >}}-compliant
account switching aid and their associated components.

At [tasko](https://www.tasko.de/), I'm part of a team of talented, enthusastic software developers
and we are working together on the future of tasko's e-commerce products. With over 300,000 products
across multiple online stores and channels, Tasko shows how e-commerce works. All this is only 
possible thanks to a concentrated, cross-team expertise that cleverly combines deep knowledge of 
retail and logistics with technology.
