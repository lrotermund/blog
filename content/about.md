My name is Lukas Rotermund and I am a passionate backend software developer working on APIs and 
microservices for [fino](https://www.fino.ai/en/), a german fintech based in Kassel.

As far as I can remember, Iâ€™ve been developing software. After graduating from technical secondary 
school with a focus on informatics, I went straight into an apprenticeship 
([a german vocational training system](https://www.bmbf.de/en/the-german-vocational-training-system-2129.html)) 
as an IT specialist for application development at a global service provider in the area of market 
analysis for the automotive industry.

I worked as a developer for a web agency after i graduated and was responsible for the development 
of big platforms based on Laravel, more complex Wordpress sites, own Wordpress themes and plugins, 
as well as the rollout and support of CI/CD and Docker.

Furthermore, I also am a certified trainer for the german vocational training system, which entitles 
me to train an apprentice.

At [fino](https://www.fino.ai/en/), I'm involved in maintenance and development of the account 
switching service, the ZKG-compliant account switching aid and their associated components.
