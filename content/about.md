I'm Lukas Rotermund and I'm a passionate backend software developer working on APIs and microservices for fino, a German fintech based in Kassel.

As far as I can remember, I've been developing software since I attended LAN parties as a teenager. After graduating from high school with a focus on informatics, I went straight into an apprenticeship ([a German vocational training system](https://www.bmbf.de/en/the-german-vocational-training-system-2129.html)) as an IT specialist for application development at a global service provider in the area of market analysis for the automotive industry.

After my apprenticeship I worked as a developer for a web agency and was responsible for the development of large platforms based on Laravel, more complex Wordpress sites, own Wordpress themes and plugins, as well as the rollout and support of CI/CD and Docker.

Furthermore, the agency offered me the opportunity to complete a trainer aptitude test for the German vocational training system, which now entitles me to be appointed as a vocational trainer for a company at the [IHK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_German_Chambers_of_Industry_and_Commerce). 

At fino, I'm involved in maintenance and development of the account switching service, the ZKG-compliant account switching aid and their associated components.
