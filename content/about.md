## Top skills

### Golang

Golang is my language of choice. I would always prefer Golang as a language for
projects because of its strict, simple and opinionated language design, its rich
standard library and the tools that come with it.

In a team, Go impresses with its beginner-friendliness, its resistance to legacy
code, its constant backwards compatibility and painless upgradeability - and in
any case with the avoidance of useless, costly and conflict-avoiding code style
discussions due to the formatting & tooling predefined by the language.

Golang can be used for everything from TinyGo on an Arduino, to creating
supporting Go scripts, to (modular) monolithic applications and microservices.
In almost all cases using standard tools and language features.

The way to install Go, develop with it, compile it and ship it in a Docker image
is so incredibly simple that you won't believe it the first time, especially if
you come from a different tech stack like the .Net world or the PHP world, where
the whole process is often characterised by complex installation processes,
painful Dockerizability  and a gauntlet of resolving (library) dependencies.

### PHP

PHP has been around forever, has been pronounced dead a thousand times, and yet
it has continued to evolve and remain the leading language on the web.

PHP is widely used by many developers, mainly because it is where most of us
started. PHP is a very tolerant and flexible language. Unlike Golang, PHP is not
opinionated at all, but can be written and formatted however you like. This
simply ensures that PHP, along with Javascript, is still a very popular language
for beginners, which is also very helpful in finding people to work on projects.

The language has also come a long way in the last few years, especially with
community-driven frameworks like Laravel and Symfony, tools like PHPStan and new
modern servers like FrankenPHP. PHP now has a decent type system and boilerplate
reducing language constructs. If you stopped developing PHP with PHP 5 because
nothing was happening in the language and PHP development was no longer nice and
modern, you should definitely take another look at the language, because a lot
has changed.

Of course, PHP still has weaknesses that should not be ignored, which is why it
is not my first choice for new projects. Many of its strengths, such as the
flexibility of formatting and tools, are also its biggest weaknesses for me. It
simply takes a lot of time to create a common baseline in the team for how PHP
is written. This includes formatting, but also tooling. In other words,
everything that is not fun and costs a lot of time and money, especially when a
team is just starting out.

At the end of the day, it should not be overlooked that running PHP is simply
not fun. Of course, there are many out-of-the-box kick-start solutions such as
phpdocker.io, or framework-specific solutions such as Symfony Docker by KÃ©vin
Dunglas, which help you set up a dockerised development and production
environment, but it's still no fun, especially when errors occur and you have to
debug them in third-party projects. Upgrading PHP projects via Composer can also
take days to weeks to resolve all the dependency conflicts, which are terrible
to read and interpret.

In the end, I started my development life with PHP anyway. I know both the good
and the bad, and I have seen the language evolve in a very positive way over a
long period of time, largely thanks to this incredibly loyal community.
