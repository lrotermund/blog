leather goods and luggage.

## Top skills

### Golang

Golang is my language of choice. I would always prefer Golang as a language for
projects because of its strict, simple and opinionated language design, its rich
standard library and the tools that come with it.

In a team, Go impresses with its beginner-friendliness, its resistance to legacy
code, its constant backwards compatibility and painless upgradeability - and in
any case with the avoidance of useless, costly and conflict-avoiding code style
discussions due to the formatting & tooling predefined by the language.

Golang can be used for everything from TinyGo on an Arduino, to creating
supporting Go scripts, to (modular) monolithic applications and microservices.
In almost all cases using standard tools and language features.

The way to install Go, develop with it, compile it and ship it in a Docker image
is so incredibly simple that you won't believe it the first time, especially if
you come from a different tech stack like the .Net world or the PHP world, where
the whole process is often characterised by complex installation processes,
painful Dockerizability  and a gauntlet of resolving (library) dependencies.

### PHP

PHP has been around forever, has been pronounced dead a thousand times, and yet
it has continued to evolve and remain the leading language on the web.

PHP is widely used by many developers, mainly because it is where most of us
started. PHP is a very tolerant and flexible language. Unlike Golang, PHP is not
opinionated at all, but can be written and formatted however you like. This
simply ensures that PHP, along with Javascript, is still a very popular language
for beginners, which is also very helpful in finding people to work on projects.

The language has also come a long way in the last few years, especially with
community-driven frameworks like Laravel and Symfony, tools like PHPStan and new
modern servers like FrankenPHP. PHP now has a decent type system and boilerplate
reducing language constructs. If you stopped developing PHP with PHP 5 because
nothing was happening in the language and PHP development was no longer nice and
modern, you should definitely take another look at the language, because a lot
has changed.

Of course, PHP still has weaknesses that should not be ignored, which is why it
is not my first choice for new projects. Many of its strengths, such as the
flexibility of formatting and tools, are also its biggest weaknesses for me. It
simply takes a lot of time to create a common baseline in the team for how PHP
is written. This includes formatting, but also tooling. In other words,
everything that is not fun and costs a lot of time and money, especially when a
team is just starting out.

At the end of the day, it should not be overlooked that running PHP is simply
not fun. Of course, there are many out-of-the-box kick-start solutions such as
phpdocker.io, or framework-specific solutions such as Symfony Docker by Kévin
Dunglas, which help you set up a dockerised development and production
environment, but it's still no fun, especially when errors occur and you have to
debug them in third-party projects. Upgrading PHP projects via Composer can also
take days to weeks to resolve all the dependency conflicts, which are terrible
to read and interpret.

In the end, I started my development life with PHP anyway. I know both the good
and the bad, and I have seen the language evolve in a very positive way over a
long period of time, largely thanks to this incredibly loyal community.

<p>
  I had the pleasure of working alongside Lukas Rotermund at Pixelwerker, where
  we both served as software developers. Lukas stood out for his passion for
  coding, his commitment to writing clean, efficient, and well-documented code,
  and his meticulous approach to problem-solving. His work ethic made him an
  excellent colleague and a great mentor.
</p>
<p>
  Lukas has an incredible talent for quickly understanding and mastering new
  technologies. I remember when he took the initiative to explore frameworks
  like Laravel, which he quickly mastered despite its challenges. He didn't just
  learn it—he made sure I benefited by sharing practical insights in a way that
  was easy for me to understand. His deep understanding of tools like Docker,
  MySQL, and Laravel Forge helped me solve real challenges I faced in my
  projects.
</p>
<p>
  We often exchanged ideas about how to improve code efficiency, and these
  discussions were some of the most valuable learning experiences in my career.
  Lukas’s ability to explain complex concepts in simple terms helped me grow as
  a developer, and our regular exchanges inspired me to refine my own coding
  practices. His approach to knowledge-sharing was not only generous but also
  instrumental in creating a culture of continuous learning.
</p>
<p>
  One of the most impressive qualities Lukas brought to our team was his
  proactive approach to problem-solving. He had a knack for anticipating
  potential obstacles and coming up with solutions before they became issues.
  This kind of forward-thinking approach saved us a lot of time and made our
  workflows much more predictable. His expertise in setting up Docker
  environments, for instance, allowed us to streamline our development processes
  and deploy updates with confidence.
</p>
<p>
  Another aspect of Lukas's work that stood out was his dedication to creating
  scalable and maintainable solutions. He didn’t just focus on the immediate
  requirements of a project but always kept an eye on long-term sustainability.
  Whether it was writing modular code or ensuring that documentation was
  thorough, Lukas approached every task with a view to how it would impact
  future development. This foresight was invaluable, especially as our projects
  grew in complexity.
</p>
<p>
  Beyond his technical skills, Lukas's interpersonal qualities made him a joy
  to work with. He was always approachable, patient, and willing to lend a
  helping hand whenever I encountered difficulties. His mentorship went beyond
  just coding; he helped me improve my problem-solving skills, encouraged me to
  take on challenging tasks, and fostered my growth as a software developer.
</p>
<p>
  I wholeheartedly recommend Lukas for any software development role,
  particularly where strong technical skills, deep understanding of modern
  frameworks, and a collaborative spirit are valued. He would be a tremendous
  asset to any team.

  If you have the chance to hire Lukas, you should. When it comes to individual
  IT projects Lukas always nailed it. His core competence is not even code. It's
  his ability to understand the business models of his clients / company and
  develop smart solutions with a high performance based on their needs.
</p>
<p>
  Furthermore Lukas is a workaholic in a positive way. He exactly knows how to
  bring the projects forward.
  If theres a marketing team to lead in the future including software engineers,
  I would call Lukas first.
