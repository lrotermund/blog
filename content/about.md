My name is Lukas Rotermund, and I am a passionate backend software developer working on APIs and 
e-commerce services for the [tasko Products GmbH](https://www.tasko.de/), the leading, 
international brand for leather goods and luggage. 

As far as I can remember, I've been developing software. After graduating from technical secondary 
school with a focus on informatics, I went straight into an 
[apprenticeship, a German vocational training system](https://www.bmbf.de/bmbf/en/education/the-german-vocational-training-system/the-german-vocational-training-system_node.html), 
as an IT specialist for application development at 
[Management Services Helwig Schmitt GmbH](https://manserv.de/en/), a global service provider in
the area of market analysis for the automotive industry.

I worked as a lead web developer at [pixelwerker GmbH](https://pixelwerker.de/) after I graduated and 
was responsible for the development of big web platforms based on Laravel, complex and customized
WordPress applications, own WordPress themes and plugins, as well as the rollout and support of
a CI/CD process and a Docker based software development.

Furthermore, I also am a certified trainer for the German vocational training system, which entitles 
me to train an apprentice.

After the web agency, I found a new challenge in developing Golang and Java APIs at
[fino](https://fino.group/), a market-leading innovation driver in account and data analytics,
regulatory, tax and document management technologies. I was responsible for maintaining and
developing the [account switching products](https://kontowechsel.de/), which included the account
switching service, the {{< abbr "ZKG" "Zahlungskontengesetz/ Payment Accounts Act" >}}-compliant
account switching aid and related components.

At [tasko](https://www.tasko.de/), I'm part of a team of talented, enthusiastic software developers,
and we are working together on the future of tasko's e-commerce products. With over 300,000 products
across multiple online stores and channels, Tasko shows how e-commerce works. All this is only 
possible thanks to a concentrated, cross-team expertise that cleverly combines deep knowledge of 
retail and logistics with technology.

## Why do I write about topics in which I am not an expert?

This is best summed up in the (translated) words of [Dina Brandt](https://www.trotzigermillennial.de/), a German LinkedIn influencer:

{{< blockquote
quote="\"New\" insights are often just the opposite of new. The more \"new\" you recognize, the more aware you become that \"new\" doesn't even exist in most cases. Then it quickly happens that you stop sharing these things with others - because they seem so unimportant and trivial.  But this is not quite true. On the one hand, there are people who have not yet had the aforementioned knowledge. On the other hand, even people who already know a lot still like to exchange information. The fear that one's own experiences or thoughts are not worth sharing is usually completely unfounded. ***Most of the time, it's only self-doubt that keeps you from doing so.***"
